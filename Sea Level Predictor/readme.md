# Sea Level Predictor

This project analyzes a dataset of global average sea level changes since 1880 and predicts sea level changes through the year 2050. It uses Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy for data analysis, visualization, and linear regression.

## Project Tasks:

- Import data from `epa-sea-level.csv` using Pandas.
- Create a scatter plot using Matplotlib, with the Year column as the x-axis and the CSIRO Adjusted Sea Level column as the y-axis.
- Use the `linregress` function from SciPy to get the slope and y-intercept of the line of best fit.
- Plot the line of best fit over the scatter plot, making it go through the year 2050 to predict sea level rise in 2050.
- Plot a new line of best fit using only the data from year 2000 through the most recent year in the dataset, also going through the year 2050 to predict sea level rise if the rate of rise continues since 2000.
- Label the x-axis as "Year", the y-axis as "Sea Level (inches)", and the title as "Rise in Sea Level".
- Save the plot as `sea_level_plot.png`.

## Files:

- `sea_level_predictor.py`: Contains the main Python script for analyzing and visualizing the sea level data.
- `epa-sea-level.csv`: The dataset containing the global average sea level changes since 1880.
- `test_module.py`: Unit tests for the sea level predictor script.
- `sea_level_plot.png`: The output plot generated by the script.

## Getting Started:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the `sea_level_predictor.py` script to generate the sea level plot.

## Development:

- You can further extend this project by exploring more advanced data analysis techniques, incorporating additional datasets, or creating a more interactive visualization.

## Credits:

- This project is inspired by the freeCodeCamp.org Python curriculum.
- Special thanks to the contributors of Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy for their invaluable tools and documentation.
